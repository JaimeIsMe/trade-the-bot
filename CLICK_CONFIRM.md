## What You See:

This is a configuration modal that's asking you to:
1. Configure WARP device profile (split tunnels)
2. Ensure local domain fallback settings

**Don't worry about the technical details** - Cloudflare is just letting you know about advanced settings. For your use case (connecting your backend API), the default settings will work fine.

## What Happens Next:

After you click Confirm, you should see:
