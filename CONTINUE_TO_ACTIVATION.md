# Review DNS Records - Click "Continue to activation"

## What You See:
✅ Cloudflare scanned your domain  
✅ DNS records detected (parking page records - normal for new domain)  
⚠️ Orange tag: "Invalid nameservers" - **This is expected!** We'll fix this next.  

---

## What to Do:
**Click the big blue "Continue to activation" button at the bottom of the page**

---

## ⏳ What Happens Next:
Cloudflare will show you:
- **Nameservers** that look like:
  - `something.cloudflare.com`
  - `something.cloudflare.com`

You'll need to update these in Namecheap (we'll do this together next).

**Click "Continue to activation" and tell me what you see!**
