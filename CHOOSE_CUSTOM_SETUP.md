# Choose "Custom Setup" for Your Dashboard

## 🎯 What to Click:

**Click "Custom Setup"** (the gear icon with cursor)

## Why Custom Setup:

✅ **Full control:** You need to upload your own files (the dashboard we built)  
✅ **No WordPress:** Your dashboard is a React app, not WordPress  
✅ **Static files:** We'll upload the `dist/` folder contents  
✅ **Custom configuration:** Perfect for your trading bot dashboard

## What NOT to Choose:

❌ **Install WordPress** - Your dashboard isn't WordPress  
❌ **Handcrafted Starter** - You already have your dashboard built  
❌ **Migrate to DreamHost** - You're not moving an existing site  
❌ **Setup DNS** - DNS is already configured with Cloudflare

## What Happens Next:

After clicking "Custom Setup":
1. DreamHost will create hosting space
2. You'll get FTP/upload details
3. We'll upload your dashboard files
4. Your site will be live at `tradethebot.com`!
