# Test the Tunnel Connection

## 🤔 Routes Showing 0

The "Routes: 0" in the overview might be a display lag or different metric. Let's test if it's actually working.

## 🧪 Test the Connection

I'm testing your tunnel URL to see if it's working:

**Testing:** `https://api.tradethebot.com/api/status`

---

## What This Test Does:

- ✅ **If it works:** Your tunnel is connected and working
- ❌ **If it fails:** We need to troubleshoot

---

## Alternative: Check Tunnel Details

You can also:
1. Click "Tunnels" in the left sidebar
2. Click on "tradethebot" 
3. Check the "Published application routes" tab
4. Verify `api.tradethebot.com` is listed there

**Let me know what the test result shows, or tell me what you see when you check the tunnel details!**
