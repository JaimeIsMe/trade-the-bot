# Step 3: Add Your Domain to Cloudflare

## What You're Looking At
You should see Cloudflare's "Add a Site" page with options like:
- Add a Website
- Sign up for Workers
- Etc.

## ✅ What to Do:

### Step A: Click "Add a Site" or "Add a Website"
This will start the process of adding TradeTheBot.com

### Step B: Enter Your Domain
When prompted, type:
**tradeethebot.com**

(Without www, just the domain name)

### Step C: Choose Your Plan
**Select: FREE plan** (click the Free button)

Cloudflare will then scan your domain to get DNS records from Namecheap.

## ⏳ What Happens Next

Cloudflare will:
1. Scan your current DNS records (from Namecheap)
2. Show you a summary of what it found
3. Give you nameservers to update in Namecheap

**This might take 1-2 minutes. Wait for it to finish scanning.**

---

## 🚨 What to Watch For

After scanning, Cloudflare will show you:
- **Nameservers** (something like `ns1.cloudflare.com` and `ns2.cloudflare.com`)
- A summary of your DNS records

**Write down or screenshot these nameservers!** You'll need them for the next step.

**Tell me when Cloudflare finishes scanning and shows you the nameservers!**
