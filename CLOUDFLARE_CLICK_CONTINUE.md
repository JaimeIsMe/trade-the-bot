## ⏳ What Will Happen Next:

After you click "Continue":

1. **Cloudflare will scan your domain** (takes 30-60 seconds)
2. It will find your DNS records from Namecheap
3. Then show you **nameservers** that look like:
   - `something.cloudflare.com`
   - `something.cloudflare.com`
4. You'll need to copy these nameservers
5. Update them in Namecheap (we'll do this next step)

## 🚀 Ready?

**Click that blue "Continue" button!**

Then let me know when you see the nameservers page (or if it asks you anything else).
