## 🎯 Next: Create Cloudflare Tunnel

We need to create a tunnel so your dashboard (on DreamHost) can connect to your backend API (on your computer).

### Step 1: Go to Zero Trust in Cloudflare

1. In your Cloudflare dashboard (where you are now)
2. Look at the **left sidebar**
3. Click on **"Zero Trust"** (should be near the bottom of the sidebar)

**Can you see "Zero Trust" in the left sidebar?** If not, let me know what you see!

## What We're Going to Do:

1. Create a Cloudflare Tunnel
2. Configure it to connect `api.tradethebot.com` → `http://localhost:8000`
3. Build your dashboard with this URL
4. Deploy to DreamHost

**Let's start! Click "Zero Trust" in the left sidebar and tell me what you see!**
