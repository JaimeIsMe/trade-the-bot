# Enter Team Name

## What You See:
Cloudflare is asking for a **team name**. This creates a unique identifier for your Zero Trust account.

**Enter any team name you want!** For example:
- `tradeethebot`
- `my-trading-bot`
- `your-name` (your actual name)
- Anything you like!

**Important:** It will become: `your-team-name.cloudflareaccess.com`
(This is just for Zero Trust, not your actual domain)

## What to Do:

1. Type in your team name (e.g., `tradeethebot`)
2. You'll see it appended as: `.cloudflareaccess.com`
3. Click the blue **"Next"** button

**Enter a team name and click "Next", then tell me what happens!**
