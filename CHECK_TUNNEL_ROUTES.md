# Check Tunnel Routes

## ✅ What You See:
You're in the "Networks overview" page. I can see:
- ✅ Your tunnel "tradethebot" is listed in "Recently modified Tunnels"
- ✅ "Tunnels: 1" and "Active Tunnels: 1" in the metrics
- ✅ But "Routes: 0" - this suggests the route might not have been created yet

## 🎯 Next Step: Check Your Tunnel

We need to verify if the hostname route was actually created.

### Click "Tunnels" in the left sidebar

This will take you back to your tunnel list where you can:
1. See if the route was created
2. Click on "tradethebot" to check the hostname routes

---

## What We're Looking For:

After clicking "Tunnels", you should see:
- Your "tradethebot" tunnel
- The "Routes" column should show "1" (if the route was created)
- Or "--" (if it wasn't created yet)

**Click "Tunnels" in the left sidebar and tell me what you see!**
